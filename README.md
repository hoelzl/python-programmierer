# Note:

This repository has turned into a kind of omnibus repo for all my Python
courses. I'm currently in the process of reorganizing, extending and cleaning up
the content. Once this is finished, this repo will be archived and the material
will be made available in the new
[python-courses](https://github.com/hoelzl/python-courses) repo.
